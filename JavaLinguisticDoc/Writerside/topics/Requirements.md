# Requirements

Before using the **javaLinguisticLib** library, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
    - You need to have the JDK installed on your system.
    - The library is compatible with Java 8 or later versions.

2. **Maven (Optional)**:
    - If you're using Maven as your build tool, ensure it is installed on your system.
    - You can include the library as a dependency in your `pom.xml` file.

3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account**:
    - To utilize the speech-to-text functionalities, you need access to Google Cloud Platform.
    - Ensure you have a GCP account with the necessary permissions to use the Speech-to-Text API.

4. **Google Cloud Platform Credentials**:
    - You need to set up credentials to authenticate your application with Google Cloud Platform.
    - Follow the instructions provided by Google to obtain and configure the necessary credentials.

5. **Dependencies**:
    - The library relies on external dependencies, including:
        - `google-cloud-speech`: for speech recognition functionality.
        - `commons-lang3`: for miscellaneous utilities.
    - These dependencies are managed automatically if you're using Maven. Otherwise, you need to manually include them in your project.

Ensure all these requirements are met before integrating and using the **javaLinguisticLib** library in your Java projects.
